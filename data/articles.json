    "content": "Summary\n\n• LM Studio offers an easy method to run DeepSeek models on a MacBook.\n• The ability to run larger DeepSeek models depends on your Mac's specs, particularly its RAM capacity.\n• While DeepSeek models may not match ChatGPT in intelligence, they are still smart and useful for everyday tasks.\n\n\nDeepSeek is a new AI from China that's been the cause of quite some uproar in the AI industry and market. While most of the attention has gone to the big ChatGPT-beating model, there are various DeepSeek models that will run on a regular computer, and on my Mac the results are impressive.\n\nThere are two ways to get DeepSeek running on your Mac—Ollama(with aDocker interface) or LM Studio. I tried both, but the LM Studio method is by far the easiest.\n\nSeek and ye shall find?\n\nFirst, head to theLM Studio download siteand download and install the application. Then run it. You'll see this onboarding screen the first time you run the app. In this case we're offered a DeepSeek model with 7B parameters, and this is a fine place to start. However, I want to run a bigger model, so for now we'll choose \"Skip onboarding.\"\n\nSince we have no models loaded, type \"DeepSeek\" into the search box at the top of the LM Studio window and press Enter.\n\nI searched for \"DeepSeek 14B\" which is the largest model my MacBook can reasonably run. You'll have a number of options, many of which have been tuned by the community. Choose whichever you like and click \"download\".\n\nAfter the model has completed its download, click on the search bar at the top of the LM Studio window again and you'll see the models you've downloaded.\n\nAfter selecting it, you'll see the parameters for the model. For now, just go with the default parameters. Click \"Load model\" and we're ready to start asking the LLM question.\n\nGetting any of the DeepSeek models to run at usable speeds depends on the specifications of your MacBook. In my case, I'm using an M4 MacBook Pro, with an M4 Pro chip and 24GB of RAM. The RAM count is crucial, since the whole model needs to fit into your GPU memory to work correctly, or at least at usable speeds.\n\nOne step away from perfection.\n\nThis is why I can run the 14B model, since it fits easily into the 24GB of RAM available, but if you're using an 8GB Mac, you're limited to the 7B or smaller models, and even then things may not run all that well. Of course, there's no harm in trying any model on your Mac. The worst that can happen is that it won't work well or at all, but it might still be good enough for your needs.\n\nTry out your very own AI chatbot privately and securely at home.\n\nSo, how well does this work? The easiest way to give you an idea is to give the same prompts to DeepSeek 14B running on my Mac and ChatGPT o3 Mini.\n\nHere's the first prompt:\n\nWrite a short cover letter as Mickey Mouse applying for a job at a mousetrap factory.\n\nHere are the results.\n\nBoth models created cogent, grammatically correct results, but 03 Mini clearly did a much better job when it comes to embodying the Mickey Mouse character.\n\nNext I asked:\n\nExplain solar power to me at the 5th-grade level.\n\nThe results are both decent, but the o3 Mini version is better written, in my opinion.\n\nWe could do this all day, and I have! My overall impression is that this 14B model, at least, is about as good as ChatGPT was when it was first released to the public.\n\nHowever, compared to o3 Mini, it's clearly not as smart.However, it's more than smart enough to do all the things I was happy to ask the original ChatGPT to do, and considering its running locally on my little laptop, that's ahugeleap forward. Even if it takes ten times as long to answer my questions, it's still under a minute in most cases. Of course, your GPU specs will affect this one way or another.\n\nNow, while I encourage anyone to try out the local version of DeepSeek, which doesn't record your private data on servers somewhere in China, there are some things to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, be mindful of which model you're using. There are already many tweaked versions of DeepSeek and some are going to be better or worse for your purposes. Second, the full-fat DeepSeek model that'sactuallycompeting with the best ChatGPT models is a 671B monster that needs a huge computer system with hundreds of GBs of RAM to work. These little 7B and 14B models are nowhere near as smart, and so are more prone to generating nonsense.\n\nThere are many great reasons to run one of these LLMs locally, but don't fall into the trap of thinking that, because the online versions are smart and accurate, these smaller models will be anywhere near as good. Still, this is more than just a curiosity. I, for one, will be leaving DeepSeek on my Mac, because even if it's ten times slower and ten times less intelligent than the best of those data-center AIs, that's still plenty smart for what most people need an LLM to do.",

    "content": "Your keyboard can double as your mouse to control the cursor. The keys can do everything a mouse does, but faster. With a little bit of practice and muscle memory, you can drive the computer faster and more easily just with your keyboard.\n\nLike most people, I used to do most of my computing with some combination of a mouse (or trackpad) and a keyboard. It’s a standard and convenient arrangement, and you rarely ever give it any thought. I didn’t either, until recently, when I bought a new wireless keyboard. It’s such a delight to use that I find myself wishing I didn’t need a mouse.\n\nI looked into mouse-free computer setups, and found that (unsurprisingly) I’m not the only one. There are a lot of people out there who want to ditch the mouse and just control their computer with the keyboard for any number of reasons. Some find it faster than switching between the keyboard and mouse (technically called “homing”). Keyboard shortcuts are arguably faster and more efficient than the mouse pointer. And if you’re controlling the cursor with keyboard shortcuts, you can get the same productivity gains. Others find it easier to use the keyboard for accessibility reasons because it’s easier on the wrists for people with carpal tunnel.\n\nWriters, coders, or people who need to do a lot of typing and cursor navigation supposedly get the most out of sending all inputs through the keyboard. So naturally, I wanted to give it a try. I found that Windows actually has a built-in accessibility feature that lets you control the mouse using the Numpad. I tried it, but it was too slow for my purposes. But I found something better.\n\nYears ago, a friend and I were obsessed with Subway Surfers. We’d play it on our computers and phones. It was fun on the phone, but using the mouse to play it on the PC got tiring really fast. So I figured out a way to play the game with the keyboard. I installed a script using AutoHotKey that translated WASD and arrow keys into cursor movements and allowed me to control the surfer.\n\nI looked for a way to do something like that, but for my entire operating system, and found tons of scripts that could do the job. I picked one with sensible shortcuts, easy customization, and a good configuration to replace my mouse.\n\nIt was a bit of a challenge at first. I found myself instinctively reaching for the mouse every few moments. After the first few hours, the keystrokes started to become more natural. A few days of working with the keyboard cursor and shortcuts was enough to register it in my muscle memory. I noticed I was working faster with fewer instances of context switching. I haven't thrown out the mouse yet, but I’m getting there.\n\nHere’s everything you need to get started.\n\nYou can download and install AutoHotKey fromthe official website. It’s a powerful automation tool for Windows that can automate all kinds of things, including button remapping. We’ll be using AutoHotKey to run a custom script that allows us to control the cursor using the keyboard. There are loads of them available for free on GitHub and AutoHotKey forums.\n\nThe script I’ve been using is on GitHub, developed by Astrid Ivy. It’s supposed to be a better alternative to the built-in Numpad cursor on Windows. You candownload the ZIP file from the GitHubrepository to get the script.\n\nYou don’t need to rely on other people’s scripts. If you have the technical know-how you cancode your own, or tweak/recompile other people’s work to meet your needs.\n\nLet’s install and run it together. First double-click the AutoHotKey setup you downloaded to quickly install it.\n\nOnce that’s done, extract the ZIP file you downloaded from GitHub. It’ll have an EXE file titled “mouse-control.” Clicking the EXE file will automaticallyrun the scriptwe need.\n\nYou can double-check by looking in the notification tray on the Taskbar.\n\nInsert and Home are the two keys you’ll be using the most. Pressing the Home key activates mouse control via keyboard. Pressing the Insert key returns the keyboard to the regular functionality. So when you’re working, you’ll switch between mouse and keyboard modes using the Home and Insert keys.\n\nStart cursor control by pressing the Home key (it should be above the arrow keys). The text “Normal” will flash on the screen to confirm you are in cursor mode. Use WASD keys to control how the cursor moves.\n\nNow that you’re familiar with how to move the cursor around, allow me to show you how clicks work. It works just like it does on mouse buttons.\n\nYou can also replicate more complex mouse actions using this script. For example, you can simulate click-and-drag using the “V” button. Just hold down the V key while pressing WASD to move windows or drag and drop files.\n\nIf you’re in Normal mode (the cursor control mode), you can press the Caps Lock key to enter Quick Insert mode. You can use it when you have to log into a site or type a URL. As soon as you press Enter, it’ll switch to cursor control again.\n\nI ran into one slight issue when using this script. I found that the pointer speed wasn’t as fast as I’d like it to be. Here’s how you can change that.\n\nFind the “mouse-control.ahk” file, right-click on it, and select “Edit Script.” Pick the “Edit with Notepad” option if asked. Look for “mouse speed variables” in the code. By default, the Force is set at “1.8.” I increased it to “2.8” to make the cursor move faster.\n\nYou can alsocreate your own custom shortcutsusing AutoHotKey.\n\nIt’ll take some practice to commit these keystrokes to muscle memory, but once you do, it’ll speed up your workflow across the board.",

    "title": "Is Your Mouse Cursor Moving on Its Own? Here's How to Fix It",
    "author": "Aman Kumar",
    "published_date": "2024-02-18T17:01:00",
    "content": "Summary\n\n• If your mouse cursor is moving on its own, you should make sure its driver is up to date.\n• You should also unplug your gaming controller from the computer to avoid it affecting the cursor movement.\n• If you're still having the problem, try some fixes like disabling the touchpad, cleaning the mouse sensor and touchpad, and adjusting the mouse pointer settings.\n\n\nDoes your mouse cursor move on its own? Don't worry, it's not possessed by a computer ghost! This issue usually happens if you have an outdated mouse driver or a game controller connected to your computer. Luckily, it's a very common problem, and we'll show you how to fix it.\n\nIf your cursor is moving by itself with a new mouse, it's likely a driver issue. This is especially common withgaming mice. Even if you have this problem with an older mouse, it could be due to outdated drivers.\n\nIn either case, updating your mouse driver is the best solution. To update your mouse driver,open the Settings appand select \"Windows Update\" from the left sidebar. Then, click \"Advanced options\" in the right pane.\n\nChoose \"Optional Updates.\"\n\nCheck if there are any available updates for your mouse driver. If so, download and install them. Alternatively, you can visit your mouse manufacturer's website to download any available driver updates. For example, if you're having an issue with a Razer mouse, visit theRazer mouse driver download pageand download the latest update for your specific mouse model.\n\nIf the update is in executable format, install it like any other executable file. However, if the update requires manual installation, thenopen Device Managerand double-click the \"Mice and Other Pointing Devices\" category.\n\nRight-click your mouse and choose \"Update Driver.\"\n\nClick \"Browse My Computer for Drivers.\" Next, go to the location where you downloaded the update, select the file, and then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the mouse driver installation.\n\nThis issue can also occur if you have agaming controllerplugged into your computer. That's because some controllers can control the cursor. So, even if you don't touch the mouse, you might see the cursor moving around because something is pushing on one of the controller's sticks, or because ofjoystick drift.\n\nThere are a couple of things you can try in this case. You can either disconnect the gaming controller, or if you have Steam installed, you can disable the Steam input settings for your controller. To do this, open the Start menu, search for \"Steam,\" and press Enter.\n\nIn the Steam client, click \"Steam\" in the top-left corner and choose \"Settings\" from the menu that appears.\n\nIn the Steam Settings window, select \"Controller\" from the left sidebar and disable the Steam input settings for your controller. For example, if you have an Xbox controller connected to your computer, you'll need to turn off the \"Enable Steam Input for Xbox Controllers\" toggle.\n\nIf directly disabling Steam input settings for your controller wasn't helpful, you'll need to disable it through the Desktop Layout settings. To do this, open the Steam client and go to Steam > Settings > Controller. Then, under the Non-Game Controller Layouts section, click the \"Edit\" button next to \"Desktop Layout.\"\n\nClick the gear icon next to the \"Edit Layout\" button.\n\nSelect \"Disable Steam Input\" from the menu and click \"Confirm.\"\n\nThat's all! You should no longer face the issue if you were experiencing it because of these Steam input settings.\n\nTo disable the touchpad on your Windows laptop, open the Settings app and navigate to Bluetooth & Devices > Touchpad. Then, turn off the \"Touchpad\" toggle.\n\nIf you're facing this issue on a Windows laptop where you have connected an external mouse, then you are probably accidentally touching the touchpad while using the keyboard. If you do not want this to happen, you'll have toturn off your touchpad. After doing this, your laptop touchpad will not work, and you can only control the cursor movement using your external mouse.\n\nThe mouse cursor could start moving on its own because of dirt or debris built up under the mouse sensor. When these dirt particles shift for any reason, like air, the mouse sensor will interpret it as if you are moving the mouse, and you will notice your cursor moving around.\n\nUse a soft microfiber cloth to clean your mouse sensor. If the problem persists, it's likely that foreign particles are built up on your mousepad. To confirm this, pick up the mouse in your hand and check if the cursor moves around. If not, then dirt particles on your mousepad are causing the issue. You'll need toclean your mousepadto fix the problem. For this, wipe all the dust particles off your mousepad using a soft microfiber cloth.\n\nWindows allows you to adjust various mouse pointer settings so you can make the mouse behave the way you prefer. One of these settings is the \"Hide Pointer While Typing,\" which makes the cursor vanish while you type. However, this feature only works in built-in Windows applications like Notepad and Microsoft Word. With this setting enabled, you might encounter odd cursor behavior in third-party apps, such as your mouse unexpectedly moving around.\n\nIf you don't want your mouse cursor moving around on its own, you'll need to disable this setting. To do this, open the Settings app and navigate to Bluetooth & Devices > Mouse > Additional Mouse Settings.\n\nSwitch to the \"Pointer Options\" tab.\n\nUncheck the \"Hide Pointer While Typing\" box. Then, click \"Apply\" and \"OK.\"\n\nWhile you're in the \"Pointer Options\" tab, you should also check your pointer speed. Make sure the slider isn't all the way to the right (Fast side). If it is, move it to the center. Then, click \"Apply\" and \"OK\" to save the changes.\n\nThat's how to fix your mouse cursor if it's moving on its own. We hope the problem is fixed now! But if you're still having issues, you should take your mouse to a repair shop. Alternatively, you can alsobuy a new mousefor your computer.",
    "html_content": "Summary\n\n• If your mouse cursor is moving on its own, you should make sure its driver is up to date.\n• You should also unplug your gaming controller from the computer to avoid it affecting the cursor movement.\n• If you're still having the problem, try some fixes like disabling the touchpad, cleaning the mouse sensor and touchpad, and adjusting the mouse pointer settings.\n\n\nDoes your mouse cursor move on its own? Don't worry, it's not possessed by a computer ghost! This issue usually happens if you have an outdated mouse driver or a game controller connected to your computer. Luckily, it's a very common problem, and we'll show you how to fix it.\n\nIf your cursor is moving by itself with a new mouse, it's likely a driver issue. This is especially common withgaming mice. Even if you have this problem with an older mouse, it could be due to outdated drivers.\n\nIn either case, updating your mouse driver is the best solution. To update your mouse driver,open the Settings appand select \"Windows Update\" from the left sidebar. Then, click \"Advanced options\" in the right pane.\n\nChoose \"Optional Updates.\"\n\nCheck if there are any available updates for your mouse driver. If so, download and install them.

    "content": "Stuff using PCI Express 5.0 is still coming out, while the PCI Express 6.0 spec is already finalized and will show up in PC parts eventually. But have you thought about what's next after it? The PCI Express 7.0 specification is almost about to be finalized, and we already have a final draft.\n\nThe final draft of the PCI Express 7.0 specification has been submitted by the PCI-SIG, the association in charge of publishing and maintaining the PCI Express standard. While this isn't the final spec, the \"final draft\" tends to be pretty final and there shouldn't be any functional changes in the final version of the spec. Without getting too deep into the nitty-gritty details of the actual specification, the big takeaway for users here is that we have a 128 GT/s raw bit rate and it's capable of transferring up to 512 GB/s bi-directionally. This is twice the bandwidth allowed byPCI Express 6.0and four times the bandwidth allowed by PCI Express 5.0, and it could translate to insane speed gains for graphics cards and NVMe SSDs once products using the spec are finally on the market.\n\nGraphics cards don't need all that bandwidth after all.\n\nThis is the second generation of PCI Express using PAM4 signaling. This advancement is yet to debut in any commercial products as PCI Express 6.0 isn't being used yet, but PAM4 is capable of transmitting two bits per symbol, effectively doubling the data rate compared to the previous NRZ signaling used in PCI Express 5.0 and lower generations. Maintaining signal integrity while doubling the bandwidth was becoming a real concern with NRZ signaling, so using PAM4 allows PCIe 6.0 to maintain a similar frequency to PCIe 5.0 signal integrity while making its usual generational improvements. As PCI Express 7.0 continues to use PAM4, it probably still has a decent ceiling for the next few gens before we need to replace it with something else.\n\nOther improvements in PCI Express 7.0 include optimizations to improve power efficiency even further and, just like every other PCI Express generation, it has backward compatibility with previous generations. This means that you should have no problem putting a newer PCI Express 7.0 card on an older 6.0, 5.0, or 4.0 slot. It will run at the older gen's speeds, but other than that, you should not run into any major issues—assuming, of course, your PC doesn't have anything else that might make it incompatible. This has been a core principle of new iterations of the PCI Express standard, and it will probably continue this way for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe PCI Express standard is one of the staples of modern computing, with a slot on more or less every desktop computer made in the last decade.\n\nIt might seem a bit weird to the average user to see that the PCI-SIG is already hard at work with PCI Express 7.0, considering that nothing on the market is using its predecessor, version 6.0, yet. And as a matter of fact, this is not weird or uncommon. The final specification of PCI Express 5.0, which is what most new hardware is using today, was released all the way back in 2019, when PCI Express 4.0 devices started coming out. We should see PCI Express 6.0 devices (that spec, by the way, was released in 2022) pop up any day now between this year and next year, while PCI Express 7.0 devices might not appear on store shelves until 2028 or 2029—and by then, we'll probably already have the PCI Express 8.0 specification.\n\nThe final PCI Express 7.0 specification should be available later this year, but again, don't expect to see it anywhere for a good few years.\n\nSource:PSI-SIGviaPhoronix",
